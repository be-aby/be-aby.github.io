			<summary>Covid 19</summary>
			<p>A new strain of coronavirus was first identified in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in late December 2019.
			It has caused a cluster of cases of an acute respiratory disease, which is referred to as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
			According to media reports, more than 200 countries and territories have been affected by COVID-19, with major outbreaks
			occurring in Brazil, Russia, India, Mexico, Peru, South Africa, Western Europe and the United States.
			On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the spread of COVID-19 as a pandemic. As of 26 October 2020,
			the number of people infected with COVID-19 has reached 43,741,589 worldwide, of whom 32,125,184 have recovered. The death toll
			is 1,163,600. It is believed that these figures are understated as testing did not commence in the initial stages of the outbreak
			and many people infected by the virus have no or only mild symptoms and may not have been tested. Similarly, the number of recoveries
			may also be understated as tests are required before cases are officially recognised as recovered, and fatalities are sometimes
			attributed to other conditions. This was especially the case in large urban areas where a non-trivial number of patients died
			while in their private residences.It was later discovered that asymptomatic hypoxia due to COVID-19 pulmonary disease may be
			responsible for many such cases.</p>

			<summary>HIV/AIDS</summary>
			<p>Although the WHO uses the term "global epidemic" to describe HIV ("WHO HIV/AIDS Data and Statistics". Retrieved 12 April 2020.),
			as HIV is no longer an uncontrollable outbreak outside of Africa, some authors use the term "pandemic". HIV originated in Africa,
			and spread to the United States via Haiti between 1966 and 1972. AIDS is currently a pandemic in Africa, with infection rates
			as high as 25% in southern and eastern Africa. In 2006, the HIV prevalence rate among pregnant women in South Africa was 29%.
			Effective education about safer sexual practices and bloodborne infection precautions training have helped to slow down infection
			rates in several African countries sponsoring national education programs.

			In 2017, approximately 1 million people in the United States had HIV; 14% did not realize that they were infected.</p>
